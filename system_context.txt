# PCDS 2030 Dashboard - System Context and Design Document

## ORGANIZATIONAL CONTEXT

Sarawak's Ministry of Natural Resources and Urban Development oversees several agencies:

State departments:
- Forestry Department
- Land and Survey Department

State statutory bodies:
- Land Custody and Development Authority (LCDA)
- Natural Resources and Environment Board (NREB)
- Sarawak Forestry Corporation (SFC)
- Sarawak Timber Industry Development Corporation

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

Currently, agencies compile quarterly reports using Excel, generating tables and graphs which are then copied/converted into PowerPoint slides. This process is time-consuming and inefficient.

The goal is to develop a progressive web app (PWA) that replaces Excel-based reporting with a streamlined web-based solution. The system should:
- Allow agencies to submit their sector-specific data
- Allow agencies to track programs with targets and achievements
- Enable the Ministry (admin) to generate consolidated PowerPoint/PDF reports

## SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

- Frontend: HTML (in PHP), CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
- Backend: PHP
- Database: MySQL
- Hosting: cPanel
- Libraries: PHPPresentation, Dompdf

## DATABASE DESIGN

The database structure supports:

1. **Users/Agencies**:
   - Admin users (Ministry staff)
   - Agency users (one per agency)
   - Each agency belongs to one sector

2. **Sectors**:
   - Categories for programs and metrics (forestry, land, etc.)

3. **Programs**:
   - Each agency manages their own programs
   - Programs have targets, achievements, and status

4. **Sector-Specific Metrics**:
   - Each sector has unique metrics (e.g., timber export value for forestry)
   - Metrics can be created by agencies or admins
   - Admin approval required for agency-created metrics

5. **Reporting Periods**:
   - Quarterly reporting structure
   - Admin controls open/close status for submissions

6. **Reports**:
   - Generated PowerPoint/PDF files for each reporting period
   - Only admin can generate reports

## USER ROLES & PERMISSIONS

### Admin Users (Ministry)
- Create/manage reporting periods
- Approve/reject agency-created metrics
- Generate consolidated reports
- View all data across sectors
- Create programs for any sector

### Agency Users
- Submit data for their programs (targets/achievements)
- Submit values for sector-specific metrics
- Create new sector-specific metrics (pending admin approval)
- View (but not modify) data from other agencies

## DATA SUBMISSION FLOW

1. Admin opens a new reporting period (quarter)
2. Agencies log in and see the open reporting period
3. For each program they own:
   - Submit target, achievement, and status
   - Add remarks as needed
4. For their sector:
   - Submit values for required metrics
   - Create new metrics if needed
5. Admin reviews submissions and generates reports
6. System creates PowerPoint slides with graphs and tables
7. Admin can also generate PDF versions of reports

## DESIGN DECISIONS

1. **Single Metrics Table**: 
   - Using one table for all sector metrics allows flexibility
   - Keeps implementation simpler than per-sector tables

2. **Agency-Created Metrics**:
   - Allows agencies to create custom metrics for their sector
   - Admin approval maintains data quality

3. **Direct Agency-Sector Link**:
   - Each agency belongs to exactly one sector
   - Simplifies permissions and data structure

4. **PowerPoint Generation**:
   - Flexible template approach
   - Admin can select which metrics to include in reports
